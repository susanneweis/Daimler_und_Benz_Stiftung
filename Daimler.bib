The striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on brain function indicate that the still widespread assumption that sex influences are negligible cannot be justified, and probably retards progress in our field.},

Despite this observation prominent in the literature, little consideration has been given to possible sex differences in outcome in both preclinical and clinical research. This Mini-Review highlights evidence supporting why studying sex differences matter for advances in brain health as well as improving treatment for neurological and psychiatric disease. Additionally, we discuss some statistical and methodological considerations in evaluating sex differences as well as how differences in the physiology of the sexes can contribute to sex difference in disease incidence and manifestation. Furthermore, we review literature demonstrating that the reproductive experience in the female can render the female brain differentially vulnerable to disease across age. Finally, we discuss how genes interact with sex to influence disease risk and treatment and argue that sex must be considered in precision medicine. Together the evidence reviewed here supports the inclusion of males and females at all levels of neuroscience research. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Recent findings have demonstrated that emotional prosody ({EP}) attracts attention involuntarily (Grandjean et al., 2008). The automat shift of attention toward emotionally salient stimuli can be overcome by attentional control (Hahn et al., 2010). Attentional control is impaired in schizophrenia, especially in schizophrenic patients with hallucinations because the "voices" capture attention increasing the processing load and competing for top-down resources. The present study investigates how involuntary attention is driven by implicit {EP} in schizophrenia with auditory verbal hallucinations ({AVH}) and without ({NAVH}). Fifteen {AVH} patients, 12 {NAVH} patients and 16 healthy controls ({HC}) completed a dual-task dichotic listening paradigm, in which an emotional vocal outburst was paired with a neutral vocalization spoken in male and female voices. Participants were asked to report the speaker's gender while attending to either the left or right ear. {NAVH} patients and {HC} revealed shorter response times for stimuli presented to the attended left ear than the attended right ear. This laterality effect was not present in {AVH} patients. In addition, {NAVH} patients and {HC} showed faster responses when the {EP} stimulus was presented to the unattended ear, probably because of less interference between the attention-controlled gender voice identification task and involuntary {EP} processing. {AVH} patients did not benefit from presenting emotional stimuli to the unattended ear. The findings suggest that similar to {HC}, {NAVH} patients show a right hemispheric bias for {EP} processing. {AVH} patients seem to be less lateralized for {EP} and therefore might be more susceptible to interfering involuntary {EP} processing; regardless which ear/hemisphere receives the bottom up input.},

Twenty-five schizophrenia patients and 13 healthy controls were tested on recognition of famous voices. Signal detection theory was used to calculate perceptual sensitivity and response criterion measures. Schizophrenia patients obtained fewer hits and had lower perceptual sensitivity to detect famous voices than healthy controls did. There were no differences between groups in false alarm rate or response criterion. A symptom-based analysis demonstrated that especially those patients with auditory verbal hallucinations performed poorly in the task. The results indicate that patients with hallucinations are impaired at voice identity recognition because of decreased sensitivity, which may result in inner speech misidentification.},

While whole brain functional connectivity ({FC}) under {NV} has been relatively well characterized, so far little work has been done on a network level. Here, we extend current knowledge by characterizing the influence of {NV} on {FC} in fourteen meta-analytically derived brain networks considering three different movie stimuli in comparison to resting-state ({RS}). We show that {NV} increases identifiability of individuals over {RS} based on functional connectivity in certain, but not all networks. Furthermore, movie stimuli including a narrative appear more distinct from {RS}. In addition, we assess individual variability in network {FC} by comparing within- and between-subject similarity during {NV} and {RS}. We show that {NV} can evoke individually distinct {NFC} patterns by increasing inter-subject variability while retaining within-subject similarity. Crucially, our results highlight that this effect is not observable across all networks, but rather dependent on the network-stimulus combination. Our results confirm that {NV} can improve the detection of individual differences over {RS} and underline the importance of selecting the appropriate combination of movie and cognitive network for the research question at hand.},

	abstract = {Whereas a categorical difference in the genitals has always been acknowledged, the question of how far these categories extend into human biology is still not resolved. Documented sex/gender differences in the brain are often taken as support of a sexually dimorphic view of human brains ("female brain" or "male brain"). However, such a distinction would be possible only if sex/gender differences in brain features were highly dimorphic (i.e., little overlap between the forms of these features in males and females) and internally consistent (i.e., a brain has only "male" or only "female" features). Here, analysis of {MRIs} of more than 1,400 human brains from four datasets reveals extensive overlap between the distributions of females and males for all gray matter, white matter, and connections assessed. Moreover, analyses of internal consistency reveal that brains with features that are consistently at one end of the "maleness-femaleness" continuum are rare. Rather, most brains are comprised of unique "mosaics" of features, some more common in females compared with males, some more common in males compared with females, and some common in both females and males. Our findings are robust across sample, age, type of {MRI}, and method of analysis. These findings are corroborated by a similar analysis of personality traits, attitudes, interests, and behaviors of more than 5,500 individuals, which reveals that internal consistency is extremely rare. Our study demonstrates that, although there are sex/gender differences in the brain, human brains do not belong to one of two distinct categories: male brain/female brain.},

This review highlights the advantages and challenges of using movies for developmental neuroimaging and explores some of the methodological issues involved in designing pediatric studies with movies. Emerging themes from movie-watching studies are discussed, including an emphasis on intersubject correlations, developmental changes in network interactions under complex naturalistic conditions, and dynamic age-related changes in both sensory and higher-order network {FC} even in narrow age ranges. Converging evidence suggests an enhanced ability to identify brain-behavior correlations in children when using movie-watching data relative to both resting state and conventional tasks.

On the other hand, decreased activity with higher language ability has been interpreted as more efficient language processing. In contrast to previous studies, the current study investigated the relationship between language ability and neural activity across different language processes and modalities while keeping non-linguistic cognitive task demands to a minimum. {fMRI} data were collected from 22 healthy adults performing a sentence listening task, a sentence reading task and a phonological production task. Outside the {MRI} scanner, language ability was assessed with the verbal scale of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence ({WASI}-{II}) and a verbal fluency task. As expected, sentence comprehension activated the left anterior temporal lobe while phonological processing activated the left inferior frontal gyrus. Higher language ability was associated with increased activity in the left temporal lobe during auditory sentence processing and with increased activity in the left frontal lobe during phonological processing, reflected in both, higher intensity and greater extent of activations. Evidence for decreased activity with higher language ability was less consistent and restricted to verbal fluency. Together, the results predominantly support the hypothesis of deeper language processing in individuals with higher language ability. The consistency of results across language processes, modalities, and brain regions suggests a general positive link between language abilities and brain activity within the core language network. However, a negative relationship seems to exist for non-linguistic cognitive functions located outside the language network.},

Independent component analysis was used to identify the default mode network ({DMN}) and an auditory {RS} network. For the {DMN}, {RS} connectivity was stable across testing sessions in men, but varied across the menstrual cycle in women. For the auditory network ({AN}), retest reliable sex difference was found. Although {RS} activity in the {DMN} has been interpreted as trait characteristic of functional brain organization, these findings suggest that {RS} activity in networks involving frontal areas might be less stable than in sensory-based networks and can dynamically fluctuate. This also implies that some of the previously reported effects of sex hormones on task-related activity might to some extent be mediated by cycle-related fluctuations in {RS} activity, especially when frontal areas are involved.},

	doi = {10.1037/neu0000338},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Natural fluctuations of sex hormones have been shown to modulate cerebral lateralization in dichotic listening tasks. Two recent studies presented contradictory notions regarding the mechanism of this effect. Specifically, whereas Hjelmervik et al. (2012) suggested that estradiol affects lateralization by enhancing top-down processes, such as cognitive control, Hodgetts, Weis, and Hausmann, (2015) suggested that the effect was attributable to estradiol-related variations in bottom-up aspects of lateralization.
{METHOD}: The present study used 2 well-established left- and right-lateralized dichotic listening tasks (Grimshaw, Kwasny, Covell, \& John, 2003; Grimshaw, SÃ©guin, \& Godfrey, 2009; Hugdahl, 1995, 2003), with forced-attention conditions to differentiate between these 2 ideas. Fifty-two naturally cycling women underwent both tasks, during either the menstrual, follicular, or luteal cycle phase. Saliva estradiol and progesterone levels were determined by luminescence immunoassays.
{RESULTS}: The results showed that sex hormones did not affect language lateralization, which may be attributable to the larger degree of lateralization yielded by the task, compared with that shown by Hodgetts et al. (2015). In the emotional prosody task, high levels of estradiol were marginally associated with a reduction in cognitive control, whereas the language task yielded no cycle effects for either top-down or bottom-up processes.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In sum, the current study revealed weak support for the idea that estradiol affects top-down control of lateralization, as measured with dichotic listening tasks. Given that the task employed in the present study seemed less cognitively demanding than that used previously, it is suggested that estradiol-related inter- and intraindividual variations in lateralization are small when task demands are low.

In general, cognitive control is suggested to be modulated by natural fluctuations in oestrogen. However, whether oestrogen exerts beneficial effects on meta-memory has not yet been investigated. The present study sought to provide evidence that high levels of schizotypy are associated with increased false memory rates and overconfidence in false memories, and that these processes may be modulated by natural differences in estradiol levels. Using the Deese-Roediger-{McDermott} paradigm, it was found that highly schizotypal participants with high estradiol produced significantly fewer false memories than those with low estradiol. No such difference was found within the low schizotypy participants. Highly schizotypal participants with high estradiol were also less confident in their false memories than those with low estradiol; low schizotypy participants with high estradiol were more confident. However, these differences only approached significance. These findings suggest that the beneficial effect of estradiol on memory and meta-memory observed in healthy participants is specific to highly schizotypal individuals and might be related to individual differences in baseline dopaminergic activity.},

A recent study (Hjelmervik et al., 2012) showed, however, that high levels of follicular estradiol increased lateralisation only in a condition that required participants to cognitively control (top-down) the stimulus-driven (bottom-up) response. This finding suggested that sex hormones modulate lateralisation only if cognitive control demands are high. The present study investigated language lateralisation in 73 normally cycling women under three attention conditions that differed in cognitive control demands. Saliva estradiol and progesterone levels were determined by luminescence immunoassays. Women were allocated to a high or low estradiol group. The results showed a reduced language lateralisation when estradiol and progesterone levels were high. The effect was independent of the attention condition indicating that estradiol marginally affected cognitive control. The findings might suggest that high levels of estradiol especially reduce the stimulus-driven (bottom-up) aspect of lateralisation rather than top-down cognitive control.},

On the behavioral level there was a significant interaction between visual half field and cycle phase with reaction times to right-sided compared to left-sided stimuli being faster in the menstrual compared to the follicular phase. These results might argue for a more pronounced functional cerebral asymmetry toward the left hemisphere in selective attention during the menstrual phase with low estradiol and progesterone levels. Functional imaging, however, did not reveal clear-cut menstrual phase-related changes in activation pattern in parallel to these behavioral findings. A functional connectivity analysis identified differences between the menstrual and the luteal phase: During the menstrual phase, left inferior parietal cortex showed a stronger negative correlation with the right middle frontal gyrus while the left medial frontal cortex showed a stronger negative correlation with the left middle frontal gyrus. These results can serve as further evidence of a modulatory effect of steroid hormones on networks of lateralized cognitive functions not only by interhemispheric inhibition but also by affecting intrahemispheric functional connectivity.},

Associations of positive symptoms with poor emotional prosody comprehension ({EPC}) have been reported at the phenomenological, behavioral, and neural levels.

We explore the possibility that the relation between {AVH} and {EPC} in schizophrenia might be mediated by the disruption of a common mechanism intrinsic to auditory processing, and that, moreover, prosodic feature processing deficits play a pivotal role in the formation of {AVH}. The review concludes with proposing a mechanism by which {AVH} are constituted and showing how different aspects of our neuropsychological model can explain the constellation of subjective experiences which occur in relation to {AVH}.},

Previous studies have suggested that interhemispheric interaction forms a key component in generating {FCAs} and it has been shown behaviorally and by functional imaging that interhemispheric interaction changes during the menstrual cycle, at least for a left hemisphere dominant task. We used functional {MRI} and an analysis of functional connectivity to examine whether changes in right hemisphere advantage for a figure comparison task as found in behavioral studies, are based on comparable mechanisms like those identified for the verbal task. Women were examined three times during the menstrual cycle, during the menstrual, follicular and luteal phases. The behavioral data confirmed the right hemisphere advantage for the figure comparison task as well as changes of the right hemisphere advantage during the menstrual cycle. Imaging data showed cycle phase-related changes in lateralized brain activation within the task-dominant hemisphere and changes in connectivity between nonhomotopic areas of both hemispheres, suggesting that changes in functional brain organization in women during the menstrual cycle are not only restricted to hormone-related changes of interhemispheric inhibition between homotopic areas, as has been proposed earlier, but might additionally apply to changes of neuronal processes within the hemispheres which seem to be modulated by heterotopic functional connectivity between hemispheres.},

	abstract = {According to the hypothesis of progesterone-mediated interhemispheric decoupling (Hausmann and GÃ¼ntÃ¼rkÃ¼n, 2000), functional cerebral asymmetries ({FCAs}), which are stable in men and change during the menstrual cycle in women, are generated by interhemispheric inhibition of the dominant on the nondominant hemisphere. The change of lateralization during the menstrual cycle in women might indicate that sex hormones play an important role in modulating {FCAs}. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the role of estradiol in determining cyclic changes of interhemispheric inhibition. Women performed a word-matching task, while they were scanned twice during the cycle, once during the menstrual and once during the follicular phase. By use of a connectivity analysis we found that the inhibitory influence of left-hemispheric language areas on homotopic areas of the right hemisphere is strongest during the menses, resulting in a pronounced lateralization. During the follicular phase, due to rising estradiol levels, inhibition and thus functional cerebral asymmetries are reduced. These results reveal a powerful neuromodulatory action of estradiol on the dynamics of functional brain organization in the female brain. They may further contribute to the ongoing discussion of sex differences in brain function in that they help explain the dynamic part of functional brain organization in which the female differs from the male brain.},

In the current study, we investigate whether sex differences in intrinsic cortical functional organization may be associated with differences in cortical morphometry, namely different measures of brain size, microstructure, and the geodesic distance of connectivity profiles. For this, we compute a low dimensional representation of functional cortical organization, the sensory-association axis, and identify widespread sex differences. Contrary to our expectations, sex differences in functional organization do not appear to be systematically associated with differences in total surface area, microstructural organization, or geodesic distance, despite these morphometric properties being per se associated with functional organization and differing between sexes. Instead, functional sex differences in the sensory-association axis are associated with differences in functional connectivity profiles and network topology. Collectively, our findings suggest that sex differences in functional cortical organization extend beyond sex differences in cortical morphometry.},

Studies in neuroscience typically have to rely on a limited set of training data which may impair the generalizability of {ML} models.

In the present study, we systematically investigated the generalization performance of sex classification models trained on the parcelwise connectivity profile of either single samples or a compound sample containing data from four different datasets. Generalization performance was quantified in terms of mean across-sample classification accuracy and spatial consistency of accurately classifying parcels. Our results indicate that generalization performance of {pwCs} trained on single dataset samples is dependent on the specific test samples. Certain datasets seem to "match" in the sense that classifiers trained on a sample from one dataset achieved a high accuracy when tested on the respected other one and vice versa. The {pwC} trained on the compound sample demonstrated overall highest generalization performance for all test samples, including one derived from a dataset not included in building the training samples. Thus, our results indicate that a big and heterogenous training sample comprising data of multiple datasets is best suited to achieve generalizable results.},

A {TIV}-biased model will not capture qualitative sex differences in brain organization but rather learn to classify an individual's sex based on brain size differences, thus leading to spurious and misleading conclusions, for example when comparing brain morphology between cisgender- and transgender individuals. In this study, {TIV} bias in sex classification models applied to cis- and transgender individuals was systematically investigated by controlling for {TIV} either through featurewise confound removal or by matching the training samples for {TIV}.

These areas were stable across samples and match well with previously described sex differences in functional brain organization.

By using machine learning to predict individual traits (phenotypes) from brain activity evoked during various movie clips, we show that different movie stimuli can result in distinct prediction performances. In brain regions related to lower-level processing of the stimulus, prediction to a certain degree benefits from stronger synchronisation of brain activity across subjects. By contrast, better predictions in frontoparietal brain regions are mainly associated with larger inter-subject variability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while movie clips with rich social content in general achieve better predictions, the importance of specific movie features for prediction highly depends on the phenotype under investigation. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of careful stimulus selection and provide novel insights into stimulus selection for phenotype prediction in naturalistic conditions, opening new avenues for future research.},

Understanding individual differences in brain functions during {NV} and their behavioural relevance has recently become an important goal.

Here, we propose a topography-based predictive framework ({TOPF}) to fill this methodological gap. {TOPF} identifies individual-specific evoked activity topographies in a data-driven manner and examines their behavioural relevance using a machine learning-based predictive framework. We validate {TOPF} on both {NV} and task-based {fMRI} data from multiple conditions. Our results show that {TOPF} effectively and stably captures individual differences in evoked brain activity and successfully predicts phenotypes across cognition, emotion and personality on unseen subjects from their activity topographies. Moreover, {TOPF} compares favourably with functional connectivity-based approaches in prediction performance, with the identified predictive brain regions being neurobiologically interpretable. Crucially, we highlight the importance of examining individual evoked brain activity topographies in advancing our understanding of the brain-behaviour relationship. We believe that the {TOPF} approach provides a simple but powerful tool for understanding brain-behaviour relationships on an individual level with a strong potential for clinical applications.},

Here, we use {fMRI} activity evoked by an emotionally charged movie and continuous ratings of the perceived emotion intensity to reveal the topographic organization of affective states. Results show that three orthogonal and spatially overlapping gradients encode the polarity, complexity and intensity of emotional experiences in right temporo-parietal territories. The spatial arrangement of these gradients allows the brain to map a variety of affective states within a single patch of cortex. As this organization resembles how sensory regions represent psychophysical properties (e.g., retinotopy), we propose emotionotopy as a principle of emotion coding.},

We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44-77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.},

	abstract = {Prevalence of certain forms of psychopathology, such as autism and depression, differs between genders and understanding gender differences of the neurotypical brain may provide insights into risk and protective factors. In recent research, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({rfMRI}) is widely used to map the inherent functional networks of the brain. Although previous studies have reported gender differences in {rfMRI}, the robustness of gender differences is not well characterized. In this study, we use a large data set to test whether {rfMRI} functional connectivity ({FC}) can be used to predict gender and identify {FC} features that are most predictive of gender. We utilized {rfMRI} data from 820 healthy controls from the Human Connectome Project. By applying a predefined functional template and partial least squares regression modeling, we achieved a gender prediction accuracy of 87\% when multi-run {rfMRI} was used. Permutation tests confirmed that gender prediction was reliable ( p{\textless}.001). Effects of motion, age, handedness, blood pressure, weight, and brain volume on gender prediction are discussed. Further, we found that {FC} features within the default mode ({DMN}), fronto-parietal and sensorimotor networks contributed most to gender prediction. In the {DMN}, right fusiform gyrus and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex were important contributors. The above regions have been previously implicated in aspects of social functioning and this suggests potential gender differences in social cognition mediated by the {DMN}. Our findings demonstrate that gender can be reliably predicted using {rfMRI} data and highlight the importance of controlling for gender in brain imaging studies.},

These task-based hemodynamic changes are synchronized across subjects and involve large areas of the cortex, and it is unclear whether individual differences in functional connectivity are enhanced or diminished under such naturalistic conditions. This work first aims to characterize variability in {BOLD}-signal based functional connectivity ({FC}) across 2 distinct movie conditions and eyes-open rest (n=31 healthy adults, 2 scan sessions each). We found that movies have higher within- and between-subject correlations in cluster-wise {FC} relative to rest. The anatomical distribution of inter-individual variability was similar across conditions, with higher variability occurring at the lateral prefrontal lobes and temporoparietal junctions. Second, we used an unsupervised test-retest matching algorithm that identifies individual subjects from within a group based on {FC} patterns, quantifying the accuracy of the algorithm across the three conditions. The movies and resting state all enabled identification of individual subjects based on {FC} matrices, with accuracies between 61\% and 100\%. Overall, pairings involving movies outperformed rest, and the social, faster-paced movie attained 100\% accuracy. When the parcellation resolution, scan duration, and number of edges used were increased, accuracies improved across conditions, and the pattern of movies{\textgreater}rest was preserved. These results suggest that using dynamic stimuli such as movies enhances the detection of {FC} patterns that are unique at the individual level.},

	abstract = {A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological "atoms". Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic {fMRI}. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-{fMRI} signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field ({gwMRF}) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-{fMRI} and rs-{fMRI} across diverse acquisition protocols, we found {gwMRF} parcellations to be more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations. Furthermore, {gwMRF} parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic {fMRI}. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that {gwMRF} parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise {fMRI} data.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Machine learning ({ML}) approaches are a crucial component of modern data analysis in many fields, including epidemiology and medicine. Nonlinear {ML} methods often achieve accurate predictions, for instance, in personalized medicine, as they are capable of modeling complex relationships between features and the target. Problematically, {ML} models and their predictions can be biased by confounding information present in the features. To remove this spurious signal, researchers often employ featurewise linear confound regression ({CR}). While this is considered a standard approach for dealing with confounding, possible pitfalls of using {CR} in {ML} pipelines are not fully understood.
{RESULTS}: We provide new evidence that, contrary to general expectations, linear confound regression can increase the risk of confounding when combined with nonlinear {ML} approaches. Using a simple framework that uses the target as a confound, we show that information leaked via {CR} can increase null or moderate effects to near-perfect prediction. By shuffling the features, we provide evidence that this increase is indeed due to confound-leakage and not due to revealing of information. We then demonstrate the danger of confound-leakage in a real-world clinical application where the accuracy of predicting attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is overestimated using speech-derived features when using depression as a confound.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Mishandling or even amplifying confounding effects when building {ML} models due to confound-leakage, as shown, can lead to untrustworthy, biased, and unfair predictions. Our expose of the confound-leakage pitfall and provided guidelines for dealing with it can help create more robust and trustworthy {ML} models.},

Such tests should take into account the variability due to the choice of training set and not only that due to the test examples, as is often the case. This could lead to gross underestimation of the variance of the cross-validation estimator, and to the wrong conclusion that the new algorithm is significantly better when it is not. We perform a theoretical investigation of the variance of a variant of the cross-validation estimator of the generalization error that takes into account the variability due to the randomness of the training set as well as test examples. Our analysis shows that all the variance estimators that are based only on the results of the cross-validation experiment must be biased. This analysis allows us to propose new estimators of this variance. We show, via simulations, that tests of hypothesis about the generalization error using those new variance estimators have better properties than tests involving variance estimators currently in use and listed in Dietterich (1998). In particular, the new tests have correct size and good power. That is, the new tests do not reject the null hypothesis too often when the hypothesis is true, but they tend to frequently reject the null hypothesis when the latter is false.},

We have labeled this general purpose network, the extrinsic mode network ({EMN}) as complementary to the default mode network ({DMN}), such that the {EMN} is down-regulated during periods of task-absence, when the {DMN} is up-regulated, and vice versa. We conceptualize the {EMN} as a cortical network for extrinsic neuronal activity, similar to the {DMN} as being a cortical network for intrinsic neuronal activity. The {EMN} has essentially a fronto-temporo-parietal spatial distribution, including the inferior and middle frontal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, supplementary motor area, inferior temporal gyrus. We hypothesize that this network is always active regardless of the cognitive task being performed. We further suggest that failure of network up- and down-regulation dynamics may provide neuronal underpinnings for cognitive impairments seen in many mental disorders, such as, e.g., schizophrenia. We start by describing a common observation in functional imaging, the close overlap in fronto-parietal activations in healthy individuals to tasks that denote very different cognitive processes. We now suggest that this is because the brain utilizes the {EMN} network as a generalized response to tasks that exceeds a cognitive demand threshold and/or requires the processing of novel information. We further discuss how the {EMN} is related to the {DMN}, and how a network for extrinsic activity is related to a network for intrinsic activity. Finally, we discuss whether the {EMN} and {DMN} networks interact in a common single brain system, rather than being two separate and independent brain systems.},

In fact, other brain states may afford a better ratio of within- to between-subject variability, facilitating biomarker discovery. Depending on the trait or behavior under study, certain tasks may bring out meaningful idiosyncrasies across subjects, essentially enhancing the individual signal in networks of interest beyond what can be measured at rest.

Therefore, naturalistic viewing ({NV}) holds great potential for studying individual differences. Previous studies have primarily focused on using shorter movie clips, geared toward eliciting specific and often isolated emotions, while the potential behind using full narratives depicted in commercial movies as a proxy for real-life experiences has barely been explored. Here, we offer preliminary evidence that a full narrative movie ({FNM}), that is, a movie covering a complete narrative arc, can capture complex socio-affective dynamics and their links to individual differences. Using the studyforrest dataset, we investigated inter- and intra-subject similarity in network functional connectivity ({NFC}) of 14 meta-analytically defined networks across a full narrative, audio-visual movie split into eight consecutive movie segments. We characterized the movie segments by valence and arousal portrayed within the sequences, before utilizing a linear mixed model to analyze which factors explain inter- and intra-subject similarity. Our results show that the model best explaining inter-subject similarity comprised network, movie segment, valence and a movie segment by valence interaction. Intra-subject similarity was influenced significantly by the same factors and an additional three-way interaction between movie segment, valence and arousal. Overall, inter- and intra-subject similarity in {NFC} were sensitive to the ongoing narrative and emotions in the movie. We conclude that {FNMs} offer complex content and dynamics that might be particularly valuable for studying individual differences. Further characterization of movie features, such as the overarching narratives, that enhance individual differences is needed for advancing the potential of {NV} research.},

	abstract = {Feature extraction is a critical component of many applied data science workflows. In recent years, rapid advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have led to an explosion of feature extraction tools and services that allow data scientists to cheaply and effectively annotate their data along a vast array of dimensions---ranging from detecting faces in images to analyzing the sentiment expressed in coherent text. Unfortunately, the proliferation of powerful feature extraction services has been mirrored by a corresponding expansion in the number of distinct interfaces to feature extraction services. In a world where nearly every new service has its own {API}, documentation, and/or client library, data scientists who need to combine diverse features obtained from multiple sources are often forced to write and maintain ever more elaborate feature extraction pipelines. To address this challenge, we introduce a new open-source framework for comprehensive multimodal feature extraction. Pliers is an open-source Python package that supports standardized annotation of diverse data types (video, images, audio, and text), and is expressly with both ease-of-use and extensibility in mind. Users can apply a wide range of pre-existing feature extraction tools to their data in just a few lines of Python code, and can also easily add their own custom extractors by writing modular classes. A graph-based {API} enables rapid development of complex feature extraction pipelines that output results in a single, standardized format. We describe the package's architecture, detail its major advantages over previous feature extraction toolboxes, and use a sample application to a large functional {MRI} dataset to illustrate how pliers can significantly reduce the time and effort required to construct sophisticated feature extraction workflows while increasing code clarity and maintainability.},

The author employs the psychobiosocial model of cognition to negotiate a cease fire on the nature-nurture wars and offers a more holistic and integrative conceptualization of the forces that make people unique.   This new edition reflects the explosion of theories and research in the area over the past several years. New techniques for peering into the human brain have changed the nature of the questions being asked and the kinds of answers that can be expected. There have been surprising new findings on the influence of sex hormones on cognitive abilities across the life span, as well as an increasing number of studies examining how attention paid to category variables such as one's sex, race, or age affects unconscious and automatic cognitive processes.  Written in a clear, engaging style, this new edition takes a refreshing look at the science and politics of cognitive sex differences. Although it is a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of scientific theory and research into how, why, when, and to what extent females and males differ in intellectual abilities, it conveys complex ideas and interrelationships among variables in an engrossing and understandable manner, bridging the gap between sensationalized 'pop' literature and highly technical scientific journals. Halpern's thought-provoking perspectives on this controversial topic will be of interest to students and professionals alike.   [features used for book mailer] {FEATURES}:  *Includes new information about sex differences and similarities in the brain, the role of sex hormones on cognition (including exciting new work on hormone replacement therapy during menopause), new perspectives from evolutionary psychology, the way stereotypes and other group-based expectations unconsciously and automatically influence thought, the influence of pervasive sex-differentiated child rearing and other sex role effects, and understanding how research is conducted and interpreted. *Takes a cognitive process approach that examines similarities and differences in visuospatial working memory, verbal working memory, long-term acquisition and retrieval, sensation and perception, and other stages in information processing. *Provides a developmental analysis of sex differences and similarities in cognition extending from the early prenatal phase into very old age. *Tackles both political and scientific issues and explains how they influence each other--readers are warned that science is not value-free. *Uses cross-cultural data and warns readers about the limitations on conclusions that have not been assessed in multiple cultures. *Includes many new figures and tables that summarize complex issues and provide section reviews.   It is a beautifully written book by a master teacher who really cares about presenting a clear and honest picture of contemporary psychology's most politicized topic.},

	abstract = {Network neuroscience has relied on a node-centric network model in which cells, populations and regions are linked to one another via anatomical or functional connections. This model cannot account for interactions of edges with one another. In this study, we developed an edge-centric network model that generates constructs 'edge time series' and 'edge functional connectivity' ({eFC}). Using network analysis, we show that, at rest, {eFC} is consistent across datasets and reproducible within the same individual over multiple scan sessions. We demonstrate that clustering {eFC} yields communities of edges that naturally divide the brain into overlapping clusters, with regions in sensorimotor and attentional networks exhibiting the greatest levels of overlap. We show that {eFC} is systematically modulated by variation in sensory input. In future work, the edge-centric approach could be useful for identifying novel biomarkers of disease, characterizing individual variation and mapping the architecture of highly resolved neural circuits.},

	abstract = {Two ongoing movements in human cognitive neuroscience have researchers shifting focus from group-level inferences to characterizing single subjects, and complementing tightly controlled tasks with rich, dynamic paradigms such as movies and stories. Yet relatively little work combines these two, perhaps because traditional analysis approaches for naturalistic imaging data are geared toward detecting shared responses rather than between-subject variability. Here, we review recent work using naturalistic stimuli to study individual differences, and advance a framework for detecting structure in idiosyncratic patterns of brain activity, or "idiosynchrony". Specifically, we outline the emerging technique of inter-subject representational similarity analysis ({IS}-{RSA}), including its theoretical motivation and an empirical demonstration of how it recovers brain-behavior relationships during movie watching using data from the Human Connectome Project. We also consider how stimulus choice may affect the individual signal and discuss areas for future research. We argue that naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms have the potential to reveal meaningful individual differences above and beyond those observed during traditional tasks or at rest.},

	abstract = {Sex differences in emotional responding have been repeatedly postulated but less consistently shown in empirical studies. Because emotional reactions are modulated by cognitive appraisal, sex differences in emotional responding might depend on differences in emotion regulation. In this study, we investigated sex differences in emotional reactivity and emotion regulation using a delayed cognitive reappraisal paradigm and measured whole-brain {BOLD} signal in 17 men and 16 women. During {fMRI}, participants were instructed to increase, decrease, or maintain their emotional reactions evoked by negative pictures in terms of cognitive reappraisal. We analyzed {BOLD} responses to aversive compared to neutral pictures in the initial viewing phase and the effect of cognitive reappraisal in the subsequent regulation phase. Women showed enhanced amygdala responding to aversive stimuli in the initial viewing phase, together with increased activity in small clusters within the prefrontal cortex and the temporal cortex. During cognitively decreasing emotional reactions, women recruited parts of the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to a lesser extent than men, while there was no sex effect on amygdala activity. In contrast, compared to women, men showed an increased recruitment of regulatory cortical areas during cognitively increasing initial emotional reactions, which was associated with an increase in amygdala activity. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Difficulties in emotion regulation have been implicated as a potential mechanism underlying anxiety and mood disorders. It is possible that sex differences in emotion regulation may contribute towards the heightened female prevalence for these disorders. Previous {fMRI} studies of sex differences in emotion regulation have shown mixed results, possibly due to difficulties in discriminating the component processes of early emotional reactivity and emotion regulation. The present study used event-related potentials ({ERPs}) to examine sex differences in N1 and N2 components (reflecting early emotional reactivity) and P3 and {LPP} components (reflecting emotion regulation). N1, N2, P3, and {LPP} were recorded from 20 men and 23 women who were instructed to "increase," "decrease," and "maintain" their emotional response during passive viewing of negative images. Results indicated that women had significantly greater N1 and N2 amplitudes (reflecting early emotional reactivity) to negative stimuli than men, supporting a female negativity bias. {LPP} amplitudes increased to the "increase" instruction, and women displayed greater {LPP} amplitudes than men to the "increase" instruction. There were no differences to the "decrease" instruction in women or men. These findings confirm predictions of the female negativity bias hypothesis and suggest that women have greater up-regulation of emotional responses to negative stimuli. This finding is highly significant in light of the female vulnerability for developing anxiety disorders.},

Two hundred and fifty effects of the experimental induction of positive, elated and negative, depressed mood in adult, non-clinical samples were integrated. Effect sizes were generally larger for negative than for positive mood inductions. The presentation of a film or story turned out to be most effective in inducing both positive and negative mood states. The effects are especially large when subjects are explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other {MIPs} yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For the induction of negative mood states, Imagination, Velten, Music, Social Interaction and Feedback {MIPs} were about as effective as the Film/Story {MIP} without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics. Effects tend to be smaller when demand characteristics are controlled or subjects are not informed about the purpose of the experiment. For behavioural measures, effects are smaller than for self-reports but still larger than zero. Hence, the effects of {MIPs} can be partly, but not fully due to demand effects.},

After evaluating over 250 films, we showed selected film clips to an ethnically diverse sample of 494 English-speaking subjects. We then chose the two best films for each of the eight target emotions based on the intensity and discreteness of subjects' responses to each film. We found that our set of 16 films successfully elicited amusement, anger, contentment. disgust, sadness, surprise, a relatively neutral state, and, to a lesser extent, fear. We compare this set of films with another set recently described by Philippot (1993), and indicate that detailed instructions for creating our set of film stimuli will be provided on request.},
